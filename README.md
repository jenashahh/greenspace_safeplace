# Greener Spaces, Safer Places: Investigating the Link Between Green Spaces and Crime in Toronto

## Overview

This repository contains the analysis and findings of a study investigating the relationship between green spaces and crime levels in Toronto. The study utilizes publicly available datasets from [OpenDataToronto](https://open.toronto.ca/) to explore whether the presence of green spaces in urban areas is associated with lower crime rates.
